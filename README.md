# Fibonacci-Sequence

## Introduction

In mathematics , the fibonacci sequence is a sequence in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. This sequence was first introduced by mathematicians in india almost 1400 years ago. It made it's first appearance in the west in 1202 by a man named leonardo of pisa, who is also known as "Fibonacci". The Fibonacci sequence was introduced In Fibonacci's first book "liber Abaci" where he experimented with the fibonacci sequence by calculating the growth of rabbit populations. Within this experiment is where he was able to discover the fibonacci sequence.

## Algorithm Description
We first define the function "Fibonacci" and we pass a parameter of (n) that returns the nth from the Fibonacci sequence. Next we create a constant called "Fibonacci" and initialize a array and add the first two numbers of the sequence which are 0 and 1. We now have to populate the array with the rest of the sequence, to do that we need to create a for loop that starts at the index of 2 since we already have an index of 0 and 1. We then iterate till we have all needed elements in the array. in each iteration of the for loop we populate the value of index i by adding the previous two previous elements in the Fibonacci array. Lastly we return our constant array.

## Fibonacci Search
The fibonacci search is a algorithm that uses a divide and conquer approach to search for elements in a sorted array. While similar to the binary search algorithm, Using fibonacci search, it divides the array into two parts that are proportional to the fibonacci sequence.



## Big O Evaluation

### Time Complexity
The function above uses a loop that iterates through the fibonacci sequence up to the nth number. The time complexity for this function is based on the time it takes for the function to be completed based on the input of the parameter n. In result the time complexity of this function is 0(n) defining it be linear.


### Space Complexity
Space complexity in the function above is O(n) as it only carries one constant variable which is the Fibonacci array. As the parameter (n) increases the array will also increase proportionally leading to a linear relationship between time and space complexity.

## Use Cases
There are many uses for the fibonacci sequence.

In art and design, many architects use the fibonacci sequence to incorporate the golden ratio in building designs such as windows, doors, and even buildings.

in computer science, the fibonacci numbers are used in algorithms such as dynamic programming and recursive algorithms.







## Edge Cases and Concerns

Memory considerations: as 'n' becomes larger, the array will also become larger, this could lead to memory issues for very large values of 'n'
